# Email Editorial Notifications

* Email editorial notifications to editors when contributors have submitted posts for review
* Email editorial notifications to contributors when editors have edited their posts.
* Email editorial notifications to contributors when editors have published their posts.

## Installation
Download the plugin and place the 'wp-een' directory into your Wordpress plugins directory (usually '/wp-content/plugins/').

## Usage
Whenever a contributor submits a post for review, an email notification will be sent to all editors informing them of the submission with a link to the post page where they can review and publish the post.

When an editor reviews the submission, and edits the post, without publishing the post, an email notification is sent to the contributor (original author of the post) informing them that the post has been updated, with a link to review the post.

When the article is published, an email notification is sent to the contributor (original author of the post) informing them that the post has gone live, with a link to the view the post online.
